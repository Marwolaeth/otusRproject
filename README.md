# Otus Applied Analytics with R project
Course project for the [Applied Analytics with R](https://otus.ru/lessons/r-for-analytics/) Otus course.

## Project purposes
The purpose of this project is to test the skills I have learned during the course and update my portfolio. HR/Labour market area was chosen partly considering my former job experience and partly to build new competence in this area, one of the few I seek to apply data analysis skills in.

### Professional
The author has never sought to be called a data scientist. This project is mere of exploratory value and is not by no means aimed to be used for research or forecasting purposes.

## Objectives and aims
My main goal was to train myself on a real problem while dealing with data I feel familiar with. The main skill I consider here is R programming, while statistical modelling is not currently an ability I can be proud of.

## Summary
The main accomplishment of this project, in my opinion, is writing functions and creating iteratively reproducible pipelines of retrieving, handling and modelling data, specifically textual and/or sparse. The results of the analysis are terrible, with huge error coefficients showing I have a lot to learn yet.
