# otusRproject
Course project for the [Applied Analytics with R](https://otus.ru/lessons/r-for-analytics/) Otus course.

## Project purposes
The purpose of this project is to test the skills I have learned during the course and update my portfolio. HR/Labour market area was chosen partly considering my former job experience and partly to build new competence in this area, one of the few I seek to apply data analysis skills in.
